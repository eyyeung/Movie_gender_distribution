It stars Johnny Vegas as small-time cannabis dealer Moz.\n\nIt is set in Salford, Greater Manchester, chosen because Duff was familiar with the area having done many stand-up gigs there during his youth. Most of the series takes place in Moz's flat and revolves around the eclectic array of characters who visit Moz to buy cannabis, socialise or both.\n\nThe closing theme is \"Song of the Oss\" from the album Nuada: Music Inspired By the Film the Wicker Man composed by British band Candidate. The series also features a number of tracks by Californian hip hop group Ugly Duckling.\n\nIt was broadcast on BBC Three in the UK, on entertainment channel 3e in Ireland and on ABC2 in Australia.\n\nFirst broadcast in 2005, seven series have been shown; the most recent ended on 30 June 2011.\n\nAfter the seventh series aired, Ideal was cancelled by the BBC. Following the announcement, writer and creator Graham Duff wrote to fans: \"As some of you may have heard, the BBC have decided against commissioning an 8th series of Ideal. The reason given was that the new channel controller wanted to make a clean sweep. It is a source of both pride and frustration that, at the point of cancellation, Ideal was attracting its biggest ever audiences, its highest profile guest stars and its best ever reviews.

It is a remake of a famous Argentine series Rebelde Way adapted for the Mexican audience therefore leading to differences in characters' backgrounds. The series ran for three seasons, the final episode airing in Mexico on June 2, 2006. Rebelde was replaced in June 2006 with Televisa's new series C\u00f3digo Postal.\n\nThe series is set at the Elite Way School, a prestigious private boarding high school in Mexico City with a major plot line revolving around a group of students forming a pop band. Additional subplots involve the school's faculty and the students' parents. One trademark of the show is the random use of English words and phrases, often used by fresa characters.\n\nA notable aspect of the series is that the actors playing the bandmembers are themselves in an actual band named RBD, and perform most of the music used on the show. They have been extremely successful in their own right, becoming one of the most popular acts in Latin America and touring internationally.\n\nRebelde began airing March 21, 2005 and ended on December 15, 2006. The show was also transmitted in 65 other countries, including Serbia, Peru, Romania on Acasa TV, Brazil, Spain on Antena 3, Slovenia, Bulgaria and from September 2009 in Slovakia on TV Doma, in Croatia on Nova TV and in Albania on Vizion Plus.", "origin_country": ["MX"], "popularity": 29.146, "media_type": "tv"}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/6m92882NmxYDRH72o00DdG6TIqI.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 467796, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "C\u00f3mo cortar a tu pat\u00e1n", "overview": "This comedy takes its cue from such female-centered films as \"Bridesmaids\" and \"Trainwreck.\" Pic centers on a woman who makes a living from breaking up couples and decides to take on the task of splitting up her sister's relationship with her jerk of a boyfriend.", "poster_path": "/arpcxmLCXyYQWfb1MuMDfl2Dhuo.jpg", "release_date": "2017-10-13", "title": "How to Break Up with Your Douchebag", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.6, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 1.421, "media_type": "movie"}], "known_for_department": "Acting", "profile_path": "/7VSPcejVdZc18DGhgBkyostCzOm.jpg", "popularity": 1.4}], "nm6996106": [], "nm0960495": [{"known_for_department": "Acting", "adult": false, "id": 1063332, "profile_path": null, "name": "Bruno Ascenzo", "known_for": [{"vote_count": 9.0, "popularity": 1.601, "id": 504800.0, "video": false, "media_type": "movie", "vote_average": 6.7, "title": "Locos de Amor 2", "release_date": "2018-02-14", "original_language": "es", "original_title": "Locos de Amor 2", "genre_ids": [10402.0], "backdrop_path": "/8BtAHTAme264CQF2g8F3ssBg9dm.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "What happens if you join a discouraged music lover with an exasperated romantic counselor and his hot friend recently arrived from Miami?

The band based themselves at a legendary recording studio integral to the unique history and character of each location.\n\nOne song was recorded in each city, and every track features local legends. Even the lyrics were developed in an experimental, unprecedented way: Grohl held off on writing them until the last day of each session, letting himself be inspired by the experiences, interviews and personalities that became part of the process.\n\nFoo Fighters Sonic Highways is, in Grohl\u2019s words, \u201ca love letter to the history of American music.\u201d Each episode delves into the identity of each city -- showing how each region shaped these musicians in their formative years and, in turn, how they impacted the cultural fabric of their hometowns. Every artist who appears in the show, regardless of genre or locale, started as an average kid with universal dreams of making music and making it big.\n\nGrohl made his feature film directorial debut in 2013 with the universally acclaimed Grammy-winning Sound City, a celebration of the human element in the creation and recording of music. Foo Fighters have won 11 Grammy Awards, including four for Best Rock Album, more than any other band.\n\nPremiering on the eve of Foo Fighters\u2019 20th anniversary, Foo Fighters Sonic Highways aims to \u201cgive back\u201d to the next generation of young musicians.
